        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the difference between a common variable and an object?</li>
            <li>What is non-strict mode?</li>
            <li>Can a property name like the example: 'real name' cause problems? It is best practice not to use spaces, such as: real-name?</li>

            <li>Is it better to use getElementBy... or querySelector?</li>
            <li>&lt;li class='hero'&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/li&gt; const textNode = wonderWoman.firstChild; Is this recommended?</li>
            <li>What is more recommended? document.createTextNode or textContent?</li>                    
            <li>heroes.appendChild(aquaman), what is in parentheses is the element text?</li>
            <li>How events can improve the performance of a website? Or how they can harm a website?</li>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>A function that is a property of an object is called its method.</li>
            <li>"this" is used to refer to the object we are working with or running right now. If we put the name of the object directly into the function, the function will not be prepared for the change like it is if we use "this". Since this function, in another context, may be is using another object. We make sure that the object used is the one in the function's context, with the "this" keyword.</li>
            <li>"this" is always used in an object context, since "this" refers to the object of the current context.</li>
            <li>"this" makes a function more reusable, but it can give more room for error. We must learn how to use it well and intelligently, to make good use of it and not make mistakes.</li>
            <li>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. ( If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method)</li>
            <li>to invoke a method (a function inside an object), we must call object.method();</li>
            <li>Objects can contain other objects, these are called nested objects.</li>
            <li>objects are copied by reference unlike primitive data.</li>
            <li>To avoid repeating function names, especially in a very long program, we can create the function inside an object, in this way we will reduce the risk of calling a function that we do not want, either because it already exists or because it is inside a library etc By putting the function inside an object, we make the function (method in this case), be used only in the context that we are working on, since we must first call the object (if we call the object we will know in which context we are working and we will not dodge context) and then the method: object.function();</li>
            <li>JSON is used to share and exchange information. Its format allows it to be read by a person as well.</li>
            <li>JSON key and values must be double quoted.</li>
            <li>The Math object can do practically all the mathematical functions, (read its functionalities when I need to do some mathematical calculation in a program).</li>
            <li>We can interact with the values of an object only using getter and setter.</li>
            <li>regExp pattern example: pattern = /[Jj][aeiou]v[aeiou]/; It means that the word must have start with a capital or lowercase j, then have a vowel, after the vowel it must have a lowercase v, then it must contain another vowel.</li>
            <li>Remember that all methods for strings, regEXp, modifiers; They can be very useful for when we are developing programs that have to check user inputs or some other program that has to do with validating inputs, or modifying strings, etc.</li>
            <li>The DOM is the tree-like structure of the html document that allows us to access each point of that tree to be able to interact, change, etc.</li>
            <li>All nodes have a numerical code to signify what type they are. 1 element, 2 attribute, 3 text, 8 comment, 9 body.</li>
            <li>document.images[0] will return the first image of all the images in the document.</li>
            <li>Using querySelector we have much more capacity and versatility to point to the DOM node that we want.</li>
            <li>The methods lastchild, firstchild, etc; they are a bit dangerous to use as they can return empty elements. (This note refers to methods used directly on variables, not methods of querySelector).</li>
            <li>classList.toggle is for removing the class name that already exists and giving it another name.</li>
            <li>variable.firstChild = to the text that contains that node, which is called the text node. The text node is quite useful for finding nodes with specific text in the DOM.</li>
            <li>Dashes are not legal characters in property names (talking about JavaScript). For example, the CSS property background-color becomes backgroundColor</li>
            <li>Inline event handlers are not recommended. The recommended way of dealing with events is to use event listeners.</li>
            <li>Parentheses are not written in a function when we are passing that function as a property of an addEventListener, if we put parentheses it would be executed at that moment.</li>
            <li>You can see a full list on the Events page of the Mozilla Developer Network here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events</li>
            <li>The keydown event is the action of pressing a key, whereas the keypress event is the action of a character being typed on the screen. The keyup event occurs when a key is released.</li>
            <li>On a touch screen, if a user touches the screen with two fingers, events.touches.length would return 2. The first touch object can be accessed using events.touches[0] and the second using events.touches[1]</li>
            <li>Touch events are complex and difficult to implement. Many of the properties and methods of Touch events are still marked as being experimental and not widely implemented in browsers.</li>
            <li>addEventListener() to add events, removeEventListener(). to remove events. When we add an event we cannot name an anonymous function because if we later want to remove that function we will need the name of the function to be able to remove it.</li>
            <li>Event Propagation is the fact that when you click on an element, you are actually clicking on all the elements it’s nested inside of</li>
            <li>The addEventListener() method has a third parameter, which is a boolean value that specifies whether capturing should be used or not. It defaults to false. Bubbling happens by default.</li>
            <li>If we want a function to be executed on several elements, instead of adding an event on each element, we can add the event on the parent element of these elements.</li>

        </ul>
