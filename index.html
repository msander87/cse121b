        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>
          This is a site to read the Book of Mormon in two different languages
          of your choice. Simply choose your chapter, book and both of the
          languages and click "search".
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          I believe in the Gift of Tongues, and do know the Book of Mormon has
          power to help the reader achieve a higher proficiency in their target
          language. This comes of course, along your dedication as a language
          learner.
        </p>
