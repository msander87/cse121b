        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>Functions are first-class objects, so they can have properties and methods themselves.</li>
            <li>We can use the browser cache to save results that take a long time to process and thus avoid wasting time and processing.</li>
            <li>Temporary variables are declared inside an IFFE and are used to avoid causing a crash while programming the code, since they only exist while the IFFE is being processed.</li>
            <li>An IFFE is useful when we want a function and its internal variables to be executed only once.</li>
            <li>Using IFFE is also recommended when we want to use strict mode, by putting strict mode in a function using IFFE we make sure that only this portion is executed that way, avoiding incompatibilities with other codes.</li>
            <li>IFFE is a useful approach for separating parts of a program into discrete sections, especially for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>One resource we can take advantage of when we need a function to be initialized in some way, but then changed, is to redefine the function by itself.</li>
            <li>Init-Time Branching is a technique where we first check some condition such as if an object exists, and if it doesn't exist we change the function with an if and else. This way we can the first time if an object is not yet created use a second option and after the object already exists use the function as we intended it to be used with the object.</li>
            <li>Callbacks are used to wait for a function to execute when an event occurs, but allow the rest of the code to continue executing while the event does not occur. (event-loop)</li>
            <li>A callback is a function that is provided as an argument to another function.</li>
            <li>The use of promises allows us to better organize our code, executing processes that must be fulfilled after others are fulfilled, and allowing the rest of the program to continue executing at the same time.</li>
            <li>A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.</li>
            <li>The difference between the yield and the return keywords is that by using yield, the state of the value returned is remembered the next time yield is called.</li>
            <li>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both.</li>
            <li>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of functions.</li>
            <li>A curried function expects that all the parameters are passed in the function, in case some parameter is not passed, the function must have a logic that does a different process to return a value consistent with the function.</li>
            <li>The main difference between client and server is that a client is a machine or a program that requests for services through the web while a server is a machine or a program that provides services to the clients according to the client's requests.</li>
            <li>To send or receive data, by far the most used in Ajax nowadays it's JSON, which is lighter and easier to parse that XML.</li>
            <li>Ajax is used to transport data back and forth between sites.</li>
            <li>Fetch API uses promises to avoid callback hell.</li>
            <li>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetcht, this method returns a promise that resolves to the response returned from the URL that was provided as an argument.</li>
            <li>Each response object has an ok property that checks to see if the response is successful</li>
            <li>Using Ajax we can receive text and file responses, using the text() and blob() methods respectively.</li>
            <li>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. We use the json() method to transform the response in JSON format to a javascript object.</li>
            <li>Object.entries() method is used to view the key and value pairs of an object.</li>
            <li>You can create your own response objects using a constructor function. These can be useful to use if you are creating an API that needs to send a response.</li>
            <li>We can get more fine-grained control over the request being made by providing a Request object as an argument. Request objects are created using the Request() constructor.</li>
            <li>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) ia s mechanism that supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers. Modern browsers use CORS in APIs to mitigate the risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.</li>
            <li>We can get more fine-grained control over the request being made by providing a Request object as an argument. Request objects are created using the Request() constructor.</li>
            <li>HTTP verbs are a set of request methods that HTTP sets to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.</li>
            <li>The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax.</li>
            <li>Ajax is something that is continuously updated, we must be up to date with its new updates to avoid errors, an efficient and simple alternative is to use libraries that take care of ajax requests, which are continuously updated and that way our codes will not remain obsolete.</li>
            
        </ul>
